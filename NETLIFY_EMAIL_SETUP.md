## Current Implementation

Your app now supports **multiple email providers** with automatic fallback:

1. **First choice**: Resend (if `RESEND_API_KEY` is set)
2. **Fallback**: Brevo SMTP (if SMTP vars are set)  
3. **Last resort**: Demo mode (logs only)

This ensures your verification emails work regardless of which service you choose!

## Recommendation

**Use Resend** - it's specifically designed for applications like yours and works flawlessly with Netlify. The setup is just one environment variable, and you get better email templates and deliverability.

Just add `RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_key` to Netlify and you're done! üöÄ
