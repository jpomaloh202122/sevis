## Hybrid Approach

### Best of Both Worlds
You can offer both options and let users choose:

```typescript
// User can select verification method during registration
verificationMethod: 'email' | 'sms'
```

### Benefits of Hybrid Approach:
- ‚úÖ **User choice**: Users pick their preferred method
- ‚úÖ **Fallback option**: If one method fails, try the other
- ‚úÖ **Better coverage**: Reach users with different preferences
- ‚úÖ **Higher completion rates**: More users will complete verification

## Implementation in SEVIS PORTAL

### Current Features
- ‚úÖ **Both methods supported**: Email and SMS verification
- ‚úÖ **User choice**: Radio buttons to select method
- ‚úÖ **Automatic routing**: API calls based on selected method
- ‚úÖ **Demo mode**: Works without configuration
- ‚úÖ **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks for both methods

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Users table supports both methods
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN verification_method VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'email';
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN phone_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
```

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/send-verification` - Email verification
- `POST /api/auth/send-sms-verification` - SMS verification
- `POST /api/auth/verify-email` - Verify email token
- `POST /api/auth/verify-sms` - Verify SMS code

## Recommendations

### For Development/Testing
1. **Start with email**: Free and easy to set up
2. **Test both methods**: Ensure both work correctly
3. **Use demo mode**: Test without real credentials

### For Production
1. **Offer both options**: Let users choose their preference
2. **Monitor costs**: Track SMS usage and costs
3. **Set up monitoring**: Monitor delivery rates for both methods
4. **Consider hybrid**: Default to email, offer SMS as alternative

### For PNG Government Portal
1. **Primary: Email verification**: Cost-effective and professional
2. **Secondary: SMS verification**: For users without email access
3. **Local phone numbers**: Use PNG country code (+675)
4. **Government branding**: Maintain professional appearance

## Conclusion

Both email and SMS verification have their advantages. For the SEVIS PORTAL, we recommend:

1. **Start with email verification** for cost-effectiveness
2. **Add SMS verification** as an alternative option
3. **Let users choose** their preferred method
4. **Monitor usage** and adjust based on user preferences
5. **Consider costs** and scale accordingly
