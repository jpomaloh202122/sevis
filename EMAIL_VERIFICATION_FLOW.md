**Date**: August 8, 2025

## 🔐 New Registration Flow

### Before (Old Flow)

2. User can log in without email verification
3. Email verification was optional

### After (New Flow) ✅
1. **User registers** → Account created as **UNVERIFIED**
2. **Email sent** → Verification email sent automatically
3. **Login blocked** → Cannot log in until email is verified
4. **Email verification** → User clicks link to verify
5. **Login allowed** → Can now log in to access services

## 🛠️ Technical Changes Made

### 1. Database Changes
- ✅ Users created with `email_verified: false` by default

- ✅ Users have `email_verified` and `email_verified_at` fields

### 2. Registration Page Updates (`app/register/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Added bcryptjs for password hashing
- ✅ Passwords are hashed before storage (12 salt rounds)
- ✅ Users created as unverified by default

### 3. Login Page Updates (`app/login/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Added password verification using bcrypt
- ✅ **Email verification check** - blocks login if not verified
- ✅ Clear error messages for unverified accounts
- ✅ Proper password validation

### 4. Email Service (`lib/email-service.ts`)
- ✅ Working Brevo SMTP integration

### 5. Database Service (`lib/database.ts`)

- ✅ Support for password hashing in user creation

## 📧 Email Verification Process

3. User record created with `email_verified: false`
4. Verification email sent automatically
5. User sees: "Account created! Please verify your email before logging in"

### Email Verification
1. User receives email with verification link
2. Clicks link → API call to `/api/auth/verify-email`
3. Token validated and user marked as verified
4. `email_verified: true` and `email_verified_at` timestamp set
5. Welcome email sent
6. User can now log in

### Login Process
1. User enters email and password
2. System checks if user exists
3. **Password verification** using bcrypt compare
4. **Email verification check** - must be verified
